# CCFI — Cognitive Control-Flow Interruption

**A control-flow metaphor for belief updating and learning-by-contradiction**

CCFI (Cognitive Control-Flow Interruption) is a communication and teaching framework that explains why new information often fails to change entrenched beliefs—and how learning can occur when a contradiction interrupts an active reasoning loop and forces a reroute.

CCFI is **not** a claim about neurons literally running computer code, and it does not replace established neuroscience or psychology. It is a **practical framework and metaphor** that aligns with known research (such as prediction error, cognitive conflict, and conceptual change) while offering a clear, operational way to design teaching, writing, and communication that actually reaches people.
