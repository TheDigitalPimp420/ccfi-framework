# How to Use CCFI

This guide explains how to apply the Cognitive Control-Flow Interruption (CCFI) framework
in writing, teaching, journalism, and communication.

CCFI is not about persuasion or forcing conclusions.
It is about creating conditions where learning occurs because an existing reasoning loop
can no longer resolve itself.

---

## The Core Principle

People do not update beliefs simply because new information is added.
They update beliefs when their existing model fails to explain something
*they already accept as real*.

CCFI works by introducing a contradiction **inside the active reasoning loop**,
not outside it.

---

## The CCFI Recipe (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1 — Identify the Loop Belief

Identify a belief or conclusion that already self-reinforces.

Examples:
- “If it worked before, it will work again.”
- “If someone disagrees, they must be misinformed.”
- “If I feel certain, I must be right.”

This belief should feel *settled* to the reader or learner.

---

### Step 2 — Show How the Loop Self-Reinforces

Demonstrate how the belief normally explains new information
and returns to the same conclusion.

The goal is to let the audience recognize their own reasoning,
not to criticize it.

---

### Step 3 — Insert an Internal Contradiction

Introduce a fact, scenario, or case that:
- The audience already accepts as true
- Cannot be explained by the existing belief loop

Important:
- Do not attack the belief
- Do not attack identity
- Do not rush to explanation

This creates the interruption.

---

### Step 4 — Hold the Pause

Do **not** immediately resolve the contradiction.

Let the inconsistency sit.
This moment of unresolved tension is where learning becomes possible.

Rushing past this step removes the effect.

---

### Step 5 — Offer a Reroute, Not a Verdict

Present an alternative explanation or framework
that resolves the contradiction without shaming or coercion.

This should feel like a *path forward*, not a correction.

---

### Step 6 — Let the Reader Conclude It Themselves

Avoid explicit “therefore you were wrong” statements.

When the learner connects the dots themselves,
the new pathway becomes durable.

---

### Step 7 — Reinforce with a Second Example

Provide a second, different case where the new framework
successfully explains what the old loop could not.

This stabilizes the new route.

---

## Example (Abstract)

Loop belief:
“If someone disagrees with me, they must not understand the facts.”

Contradiction:
“A well-informed expert disagrees while sharing the same facts.”

Pause:
Why doesn’t the belief explain this case?

Reroute:
The disagreement may come from differing assumptions or models,
not lack of information.

---

## Ethical Use

CCFI should be used to support:
- Learning
- Clarity
- Understanding
- Media literacy

It should **not** be used to:
- Manipulate
- Trap
- Humiliate
- Override consent

The goal is insight, not compliance.

---

## Final Note

CCFI works best when:
- The contradiction is real
- The audience can verify it themselves
- The pause is respected
- The reroute is optional

Learning happens when people choose the new path
because the old one no longer works.
